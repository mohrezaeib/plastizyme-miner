# Plastizyme Miner
Identify potential plastic degrading enzymes (PET), by analysing metagenomic data.
This Repository is based on previous work by ProteinGAN [link to proteingan] and ESM [link to esm model]
ProteinGAN is tailored to augment PET degrading enzyme  dataset.
The Enriched dataset is utilized to train a classifier  based on ESM model.
